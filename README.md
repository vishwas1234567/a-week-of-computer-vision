# a-week-of-computer-vision

hai folks i am Vishwas N from RNS insititute of technolgy as I am preparing for my exams i thought it will be better for me to take break and make a repo on copmplete computer vision and the application of this field of study is more unique and also we can applpy these technique in any field  thus having a core intrest in this field,this repo will contain a lot of basics and some theory that is required for making an application.


I will start with numpy,opencv,keras,tensorflow and also will parally work on the scikit-image also i will also be working on some algorithm.


--reference books are from diffrent publication in the end of the code i will be saying the details about the code
--the code in this practice will be given for the 
---i will also be adding some ground breaking researcb papers from arxiv sanity from the developer community.

--i will also add some resources 

I will be speniding 12 hours on coding and also will be spending 4 hours more on making a project may be or even more but i will try my best to do as good as possible.

Day 1: Numpy(Image,DSP and other techniques also "will try may be"),scipy(Image and DSP)

Day 2: OpenCV basics to the advanced

Day 3: Tensorlfow baics and Advanced

Day 4: Sound and image processing using numpy,tensorlflow and other techniques suing librosa and also other modules.

Day 5: Tensorflow ad=vanced techniques all these techniques i will also devlop using keras

Day 6: Tensorflow advanced for the new arcitecture

Day 7: Advanced algorithms and implementation 


Week 2:


Day 1: Tenssrflow js deployment begining

Day 2: Tensorflow js application development begining.

Day 3: Tensorflow js and model deployment

Day 4: tensorflow js and model deployment

DAy 5: Transfer learning

Day 6: Real time model deployment begining

Day 7: Make the bot may be a telegram bot


Week 3:


Day 1: Deployment or the model for the lambda architecture of the Machine learning.

Day 2: Continue the lambda architecture

Day 3: The tools for the image processing.

Day 4: Deployment of the model for the lambda architecure and the real time prediction.
